## Description

My Sport Stats is for athletes trying to improve thier performance by tracking their statistics and using that to improve themselves. This application allows the user to create accounts, save stats and delete thier stats. As well as seeing the statistics of all the users. This project combines everything I have learnt about MERN stack as well as dealing with Semantic UI component library for CSS. It was quite enjoyable for most of the time working on it and I look forwards to continuing to improve this application.

## Deployed

This application is deployed at heroku:
https://vast-reaches-36885.herokuapp.com/
`NOTE: Currently needs to be manually refreshed to see new data.`

## Usage

This site is nice and simple for a user. They need to just create a new account or login, and after that they are able to head to their dashboard to fill out a form with the statistics from the sport they played and submit it. After that they are able to visually see the stats on their personal stats page as well as view a global statistics page.

* Fix the styling to be consistent and add colours.
* Add in more stats and render them in a nice way.
